class prioritydict(dict):
    """Dictionary that can be used as a priority queue.

    Keys of the dictionary are items to be put into the queue, and values
    are their respective priorities. All dictionary methods work as expected.
    The advantage over a standard heapq-based priority queue is
    that priorities of items can be efficiently updated (amortized O(1))
    using code as 'thedict[item] = new_priority.'

    The 'smallest' method can be used to return the object with lowest
    priority, and 'pop_smallest' also removes it.

    The 'sorted_iter' method provides a destructive sorted iterator.

    This implemented is based on:

      Matteo Dell'Amico's implementation
      http://code.activestate.com/recipes/522995-priority-dict-a-priority-queue-with-updatable-prio/

         which is based on David Eppstein's implementation
